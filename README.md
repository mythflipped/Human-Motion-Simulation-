# Human motion simulation based on micro Doppler effect using computer motion data
The data comes from [MOCAP](http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu/)
This is the source code of my final thesis in SUSTech.
My Simulation Step is as followsï¼š

1.Load c3d file and convert it to matrix.

2.Calculate the Radar Cross Section of human at every moment.

3.Generate radar response.

4.Using STFT to extract human Micro-doppler spectrum.


There are many **imperfections** in this code. 

If you have any improvements or problems you want to discuss with me, please email me and I will do my best to help you.
